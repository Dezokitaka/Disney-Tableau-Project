# Disney-Tableau-Project
This project uses a data set found on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/disney-movies-19372016-total-gross).
The main objective I gave myself for this project was to find data that I can visualize using Tableau. Since Tableau is my most used visualization tool I figured it would be
a good idea to showcase these skills. In this project I have two dashboards, the first dashboard shows the cumulative gross profit Disney has made from  movie sales between 1937-2016.
The second dashboard has three charts, sales per day of release, sales per genre, and sales per rating. My finds have shown that movies released on Fridays generally do the best by at least
4x the profits of the second highest day which is Wednesday. Also adventure movies and movies that have a mpaa rating of PG generally do the best.

The links to the two dashboards are linked to my Tableau public which can be accessed from the two links listed below.
